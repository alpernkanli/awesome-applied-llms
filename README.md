# Awesome Applied LLMs

An awesome &amp; curated list of resources for building products around LLMs, and machine learning models in general.

> "There’s a large class of problems that are easy to imagine and build demos for, but extremely hard to make products out of. For example, self-driving: It’s easy to demo a car self-driving around a block; making it into a product takes a decade." - Andrej Karpathy  

In the past few years, we witnessed a high hype towards LLM-powered products. Pioneers, visionaries and copycats. Beyond the hype, practical insights on applying AI effectively are accumulating, revealing patterns and challenges in real-world implementation.

**So, I decided to collect the applied LLM content I like. Feel free to contribute!**
